Test von Veto
pr_opener Veto ignored? -> no, it can not be.
regexpattern should be changed.
Yes, it is. Now you approve over the message "approved"!
Likely to be changed back to thumbs up though.
"approved" will be contd for now, but thumbs up is in too.
Are :\+1: | :\-1: valid patterns?

pr_opener can't review his own pr, what if he is the only one that can approve via CODEOWNER file?
With two people only, the other one is required to review.

Does the notification for Codeowners work correct?
New line added. 
Another one.
